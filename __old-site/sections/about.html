            <h5>We are the Georgia Tech Visual Analytics Lab.</h5> The goal of our research is to develop interactive visual analytic applications that <b>help people make sense of data.</b> We approach this challenge through combining scientific techniques from information visualization, machine learning, data mining, and human-computer interaction to produce usable, yet powerful visual analytic applications.
