            User interaction for visualization that lets people demonstrate intended visual mappings, data
            transformations, visual representations, and analytic methods to explore data. Visual Analytics by

            analytic operations.

          <span>
            People are critical to human-in-the-loop visual analytics. Systems learn important domain expertise from
            people, and combined with the visualization and computational strengths of VA, lead to impactful insights.
            However, we learn from the cognitive sciences that people can be biased. This projects explore how to build
            systems that detect and mitigate potentially biased strategies.

            Automotive Safety Engineering data comprises several heterogenous datasets - Requirements, Failure Mode
            Effect Analysis, Functional Safety, Tests, etc. Using these datasets, this project builds interactive visual
            analytics systems to help answer specific questions as well as allow exploratory data analysis with an aim
            to enable better decision making and eventually safer cars!

            This project addresses the task of automating the data analysis pipeline by aiding users in selecting
            complex model pipelines through data-driven automated processes. With our proposed system, a subject matter
            expert (SME) with little or no background in data science will still be able to perform complex data
            analysis without understanding the mathematics behind the analysis.

            Gaggle is a multi-model visual analytic system that enables users to interactively navigate the vast space
            of classification and ranking models. It translates user interactions into inferences, then simplifies work-
            ing with multiple machine learning models by automatically finding the best model from this high-dimensional
            model space to support various user tasks.

          <br />
          <span>
            QUESTO presents an approach that allows users to generate objective functions for classification problems
            through an interactive visual interface. Our approach adopts a semantic interaction design in that user
            interactions over data elements in the visualization are translated into objective function terms. The
            generated objective functions are solved by a machine learning solver that provides candidate models, which
            can be inspected by the user, and used to suggest refinements to the specifications.
