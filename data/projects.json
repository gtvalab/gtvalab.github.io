Systems learn important domain expertise from people, and combined with the visualization and computational strengths of VA, lead to impactful insights. However, we learn from the cognitive sciences that people can be biased. This projects explore how to build systems that detect and mitigate potentially biased strategies."

Our approach adopts a semantic interaction design in that user interactions over data elements in the visualization are translated into objective function terms. The generated objective functions are solved by a machine learning solver that provides candidate models, which can be inspected by the user, and used to suggest refinements to the specifications."
